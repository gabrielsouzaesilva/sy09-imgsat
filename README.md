# Projet SY09 - Data Science

This repository contains my work developed in the course SY09 - Data Science at the Technological University of Compi√®gne. The project was developed by 3 students, but here it only contains my part of the work and all the code wrote by me. The data was provided by the professor and it is available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Crowdsourced+Mapping

The study goal was to apply all the concepts and techniques saw in classe to create a complete data sience analysis and set up the best classification model for a series of satellite images. Our dataset was composed of various landscape satellite images labeled with the landscape class. All the process used to find our conclusions is discribbed in the report available in the repository.

## Personnal contribuition to project
### Exploratory Analysis
In this part I tried to provid the team with insights about the data to later try to explain our choices. The analysis also helped to better understand the problem and see which points are interesting of study.

### Model Selection
Here I made a pipeline for model selection.
